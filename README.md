 About 
 </h2>
Base Structure for Retrain machine learning model with Hyperparameter tuning. Made for Regression problems, Dev can retrain, optimize and find the best model for the problem out of 11 Algorithms and go for the best from it.

### To do before running
* Go to `./params` folder where multiple YAML files are created, files are named as their algorithms name. dev only changes the hyperparameters he wants to search for every algorithm.
* run the `train.py` file for start the training or can use the pre-build the `flask` API to starting the training.
